## =^.^= Hello =^.^=

I'm Daniela Petruzalek, a software engineer from Brazil 🇧🇷, but currently living in the UK 🇬🇧.

My specialisation is backend and data engineering and I'm currently a Developer Relations Engineer at Google 👩‍💻🥑

I'm interested in:
- Go programming
- Python 🐍
- Databases
- Data processing (Apache Spark)
- Recommendation systems
- Game development (specially retro) 🕹️
- Cats, lot's of cats 🐈‍⬛

This is my personal GitHub profile where I store my experiments, supporting materials for my talks and a few **actual** open source projects.
