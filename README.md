## =^.^= Hello =^.^=

I'm Daniela Petruzalek, a software engineer from Brazil 🇧🇷, but currently living in the UK 🇬🇧.

My specialisation is backend and data engineering and I'm currently a Developer Relations Engineer at Google 👩‍💻🥑

I'm interested in:
- Go programming
- Python 🐍
- Databases
- Data processing (Apache Spark)
- Recommendation systems
- Game development (specially retro) 🕹️
- Cats, lot's of cats 🐈‍⬛

This is my personal GitHub profile where I store my experiments, supporting materials for my talks and a few **actual** open source projects. Please check out the most important ones:
- https://github.com/danicat/pacgo: Write a Pac Man Clone from Scratch while learning Go
- https://github.com/danicat/read.dbc: A tool to read files only the Brazilian government cares to use

I'm always open to collaborations and I love to speak at tech conferences. If you are curious about the previous talks I gave most of them are listed in my [public speaking](https://github.com/danicat/public-speaking) repository.

Finally, please check out my [personal blog](https://danicat.dev), where I write my thoughts, tutorials and news about everything I'm currently working on.
